- Invisible/Unknown enemies shouldn't be listed for players who shouldn't see them ( more info to collect on this topic )
- Icons to identify combatant owned by players ( show the circle/color similar to what happens with targeting? )
- Sorting options for players/gm. Gm can sort by level/stats too?

- Add Localizations ( Error/Warning messages + UI )

- Override the End turn button for players.
- Expose macro to open the selection window.
- Configuration option should be reachable from the Selection window.

- Play animation when showing the Selection Window - Slide In/Slide Out
- Selection Window should be close without right clicking ( X button or by confirm ). The x button could be a tool icon
- No need for minimize/maximize opzios.
- Possibility to ask for initiative rolls everytime a round is over
- When the player is the last one of the round he can select any of the players who start the round if the "Initiative Roll for each round" is disabled. 

- Ability for the GM to bring back a combatant in the same round
- Drawer for the Previous Actors to gain space.
- Show the previous actors list by showing the latest combatant at the top of the list

- Check if this module can work with other turn based systems.

Module Configuration
- Macro drag&drop
- Enable/Disable the overriding of the "next turn/end turn" button
- Enable/Disable initiative roll at the end of each round ( with link the two request rolls module )
- Enable/Disable the possibility to select the same combatant when you're the last of your round ( to avoid, or not, players who play again immediately after their turn )
- Different size preset ( Small, Medium, Large )
- Different appearing spot ( 4 Corners or just Center )
- If the appearing spot is set to center give the possibility to save the position

#Compatibility Checks
- What happens with the boundaries applied by the module? Is the camera going to focus by breaking the block of the pan?
